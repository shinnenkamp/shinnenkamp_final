DEFINING DIAGRAM:

INPUTS: 
  userHeight 
  userWeight

  prompt user for "y" to calculate BMI or "n" to stop
  prompt user for userHeight
  prompt user for userWeight
  calculate BMI
  determine BMI category
  
OUTPUTS:
  BMI
  Category
  

SOLUTION ALGORITHM:
calculateBMI
  prompt for calculations or to stop
  prompt for userHeight
  prompt for userWeight
  calculate BMI
  IF BMI < 18.5 then
    display "Your BMI is BMI, which falls within the underweight range."
  ELSE IF BMI > 18.5 && BMI <= 24.9 then
    display "Your BMI is BMI, which falls within the normal range."
  ELSE IF BMI >= 25 && BMI <= 29.9
    display "Your BMI is BMI, which falls within the overweight range."
  ELSE IF BMI >= 30 then
    display "Your BMI is BMI, which falls within the obese range."
  END IF
  Display output
END
